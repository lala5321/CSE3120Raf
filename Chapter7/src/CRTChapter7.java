	1. The characteristics that are common in all circles is the
	center point, radius value and PI. Circle is a shape thus it should
	also encapsulate attributes that are common to all other shapes like
	the width(), height(), draw(), outline() and many others.

	2. The name of the constructor must be the exact same as the
	class name and if you do provide more than one constructor,
	the arguments in the constructor must differ in a number
	or in type from the other constructors.

	3. Public access modifier allows a code from outside or inside
	the class methods and the properties of the class while the
	private modifier prevents access to a class's method from
	any code which is outside the class.

	4. The last statement is invalid because the private data
	member radius cannot be accessed by the client code.

	5. a. The name of the class is Roo
	   b. private int x;
	   c. getX
	   d. setX
	   e. factor()
	   f. Roo
	   g. 4

	6. A class acts like a template or platform for the objects.
	The class defines objects properties which includes values. The class
	describes the particular behavior of an object. An object is a
	member of a class.
